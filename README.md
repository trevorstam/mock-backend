## mock-backend

This repo consists of code for a simple mock backend serving up a json file with addresses. You can add any JSON file to test requests to the backend from the frontend without setting up an entire REST API. We'll use the **json-server** npm module to get it running from your localhost.

---

To start your project:
1. `git clone` this repo
2. `npm i` to install all dependencies
3. Add json data of your choice to **db.json** file
4. Type `npm start` to start the mock server

Once you start the mock server, you can test the endpoints with Postman or any other service of your choice
